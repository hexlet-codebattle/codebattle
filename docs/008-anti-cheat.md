Anti‑Cheat & Dispute Resolution (MVP)

Players can report suspected cheating.

Admins review evidence; if cheating is confirmed:

Offending player’s match result may be voided/banned per policy.

The victim’s tournament score for the game is recalculated to a fair value (e.g., set to the average winners' score for that task or a policy‑defined replacement).

Admin actions may update tournament_results.was_cheated and trigger a recompute of tournament aggregates/places.

Elo is not granted for bot games or timeouts; cheating cases follow the same Elo exclusions until a fair game result exists.
