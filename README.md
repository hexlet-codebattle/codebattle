### Troubleshooting

- Install and run docker

Make sure you have installed `docker` for your OS.

https://docs.docker.com/install/

Make sure your docker daemon is running. You can run it manually by typing:

```
sudo dockerd
```

or you can add it to startup by typing:

```
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Close and open your terminal if docker daemon didn't start immediately.

- Manage Docker as a non-root user

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

Create the docker group.

```
sudo groupadd docker
```

Add your user to the docker group.

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
