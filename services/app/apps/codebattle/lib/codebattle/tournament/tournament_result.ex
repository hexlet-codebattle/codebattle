    Here we calculate the score for each player based on the tasks that all players solved.
    1. Obtain the 95th percentile for each task based on the winners game time.
    2. Calculate the `time_coefficient` for each player based on their game time:
      - `time_coefficient` equals 100% if their time is less than the 95th percentile.
      - `time_coefficient` equals 30% for the slowest time among all winners.
      - `time_coefficient` linearly decreases from 100% to 30% based on the line
         from the 95th percentile time to the slowest time.
    3. Each task level has a `base_score`:
      - Elementary: 30
      - Easy: 100
      - Medium: 300
      - Hard: 1000
    4. Each player has a `test_result_percent` ranging from 100% to 0%, where the winner always has 100%.
    5. The final score is calculated as `base_score` * `time_coefficient` * `test_result_percent`.

    Example:
    Task level is hard, so the base score = 1000
    95th Percentile = 104.0 seconds
